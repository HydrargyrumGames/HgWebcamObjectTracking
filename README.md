<br>This is an independent, completely transparent, and customizable Object-Tracking solution using Chroma-Key and Luma-Key technologies.

Disclaimer: This asset requires a "Color picker / Eye Dropper" to properly set the luma Key color for each Tracker if you are planning to build your game; (The Unity Editor color picker works just fine in the Editor) You might want to either design a solution of yours or use one of many free solutions available on the Asset store;
