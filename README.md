⭐Detailed Describtion of Product: 

This is an independent, completely transparent, and customizable Object-Tracking solution using Chroma-Key and Luma-Key technologies. It Does Not need any “OpenCV” or any other similar libraries to work. It works on all platforms that support ComputShader(s) and only needs the Webcam feedback to work properly.
This asset uses the "Contrast difference" between the Object you want to track and your environment to properly detect the Screen-Space position of an Object; [Note that this asset relies on Chroma-Keying the object to track its position;]

Disclaimer: This asset requires a "Color picker / Eye Dropper" to properly set the luma Key color for each Tracker if you are planning to build your game; (The Unity Editor color picker works just fine in the Editor) You might want to either design a solution of yours or use one of many free solutions available on the Asset store;
